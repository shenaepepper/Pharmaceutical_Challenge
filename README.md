I think I did everything correctly I did struggle with the line chart. Couldnt figure out why it wouldn't work it is probably something very simple that I have missed because my code looks correct to me. My code it saved in Untitles-checkpoint.ipynb.

The 3 overall observations are:

Effectiveness of Drug Regimens:
Capomulin and Ramicane appear to be the most effective drug regimens in reducing tumor volume, as indicated by their smaller median tumor volumes in the box plot. This suggests that these treatments have a more significant impact on reducing tumor size compared to other regimens like Infubinol and Ceftamin.

Gender Balance and Data Quality:
The study exhibits a nearly balanced distribution of male and female mice, as shown in the pie chart. This balance is important for ensuring that any observed effects of the drug regimens are not gender-biased. It also suggests that data quality and integrity are maintained by representing both genders equally in the study.

Correlation Between Mouse Weight and Tumor Volume:
There is a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume in mice treated with Capomulin. This observation from the scatter plot and linear regression analysis implies that heavier mice tend to have larger average tumor volumes. Understanding this correlation is crucial when assessing the impact of weight on treatment outcomes.

These three overall observations highlight the effectiveness of certain drug regimens, the importance of data quality and gender balance, and the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume. These insights contribute to a better understanding of the study's results and potential areas for further investigation and analysis.
